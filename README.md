This is my project of the login page , I had fun coding this part of the app and i had problems regarding the new versions of flutterfire cli initialization , improvements can be a better ui and more coherent seperation of logic and UI  

right now  structure is :- 
lib/
│
├── constants/
│   └── app_colors.dart has the colors of shades of orange color
│
├── pages/
│   ├── auth_page.dart        UI 
│   ├── home_page.dart        Home page
│
├── main.dart                 
└── services/
    └── auth_service.dart     Logic of seperating the register and login user using a variable _islogin which is a bool

inorder to run my project :- 
Flutter SDK installed (flutter --version)
Firebase CLI installed (firebase --version)
and flutter run
